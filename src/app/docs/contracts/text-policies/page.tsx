      <h2 id="why-freeform-exists">Why freeform exists</h2>
      <p>
        A binary text model (planned-exactly or forbidden) rejects charm along with garble: a
        pizzeria sign, a scoreboard digit, ambient shop lettering. Those are context, and often a
        plus. What must never ship is <em>garbled</em> text. <code>freeform</code> keeps the charm
        and still catches the garble, because the gate&rsquo;s question changes from &ldquo;is there
        text?&rdquo; to &ldquo;is every piece of text readable and correctly spelled?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <Callout title="Who chooses the policy">
        The pack planner assigns a policy per item as part of the manifest contract — it is not a
        caller preference. Single-asset runs may pass it directly; when absent, it derives from the
        legacy binary flag so existing integrations keep their exact behavior.
