      <p>
        When one workload trips two unrelated ceilings — output tokens <em>and</em> wall-clock —
        the architecture is past its scale, and raising limits just moves the cliff. Chunking
        keeps every call inside proven limits at any pack size, and a failed chunk retries at
        chunk size instead of losing the whole plan.
