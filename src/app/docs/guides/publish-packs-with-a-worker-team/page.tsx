      <h2>Step 1 — Create the outlet</h2>
      <p>
        An <a href="/docs/concepts/outlets">outlet</a> is a channel defined by a URL: a site plus a section. It carries
        the ingest endpoint and the signing secret, and records delivery health so you can see whether your site
        actually accepted the last push.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock title="the publishing channel" language="http">
        {outletCreate}
      </CodeBlock>
      <Callout title="The secret is shown once">
        <code>revalidateSecret</code> is returned only on create and rotate. Deliveries are signed with a Standard
        Webhooks HMAC over the exact request bytes — verify that signature before trusting a payload. See{' '}
        <a href="/docs/guides/connect-a-consumer-site">Connect a consumer site</a> for a worked verification example.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Step 2 — Create the team</h2>
      <p>
        Designating an outlet on the team makes it a <strong>fence</strong>: every member&rsquo;s publishable output
        ships there, and no member-level setting can override it. That is what you want for a crew whose entire
        purpose is one destination.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock title="the crew" language="http">
        {teamCreate}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Step 3 — Create the workers</h2>
      <p>
        Give each worker a narrow subject area. The specialty is not decoration — it is the standing demand signal
        that steers every plan, so &ldquo;automotive&rdquo; and &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; build genuinely different
        catalogs rather than two flavors of one.
