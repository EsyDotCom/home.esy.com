            An order fans one workflow template out into N child runs with automated variation — the batch
            primitive behind catalog production. Every worker shift places its work as orders, so batches carry
            the same telemetry, budgets, and provenance as single runs.

      <p>
        Creating an order plans it — variations resolve into children, the whole batch is estimated and checked
        against budgets — but nothing executes until the explicit start. Review the plan, then commit.

      <CodeBlock title="an order, settled" language="json">

      <h2>What each child carries</h2>
      <Table
        head={['Field', 'Meaning']}
        rows={[
          [<code key="p">parentOrderId</code>, 'The order that fanned it out — list children with GET /v1/runs?parentOrderId=.'],
          [<code key="d">orderDedupeKey</code>, 'A deterministic key per planned variation: re-running an order skips already-succeeded keys instead of regenerating.'],
          [<code key="w">workerId</code>, 'Set when a worker’s shift placed the order — the whole batch is attributed.'],
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Budgets</h2>
      <p>
        Orders take their own cap (<code>budgetLimitUsd</code>, default <code>hard_stop</code>) on top of
        workspace and project budgets. Enforcement happens pre-flight on estimates: a batch that would breach
        never starts.
