        title="Artifacts"
        lead={
          <>
            Artifacts are the durable outputs produced by workflow runs — visual, video, research, or knowledge.
            Every artifact carries provenance back to the workflow and run that produced it.
          </>
        }

      <h2>Produced and consumed</h2>
      <p>
        An artifact is a first-class value: a run can both <strong>produce</strong> one and{' '}
        <strong>consume</strong> one. A workflow is, in effect, a function over artifacts — it takes
        zero or more artifacts (plus intake) and produces one.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock title="the shape of a workflow" language="text">
        {`Workflow : Artifact* -> Artifact`}
      </CodeBlock>
      <p>
        This is why composition works two ways. A workflow can obtain an input artifact by{' '}
        <em>generating</em> it inline (a <a href="/docs/concepts/sub-workflows">sub-workflow</a>) or by{' '}
        <em>accepting</em> one you already have (an <a href="#artifact-inputs">artifact input</a>).
      </p>

      <h2>Artifact classes</h2>
      <Table
        head={['Class', 'Content']}
        rows={[
          [<code key="v">visual</code>, 'Images: clip art, illustrations, coloring pages, covers.'],
          [<code key="vd">video</code>, 'Short-form video: scenes, stitched films, animations.'],
          [<code key="r">research</code>, 'Structured research outputs and screenplays.'],
          [<code key="k">knowledge</code>, 'Project state, decisions, and reusable context records.'],
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Every artifact references the <code>runId</code> and <code>templateId</code> that produced it, so you can
        trace prompt, provider, model, timing, cost, and review state from any persisted output through{' '}
        <code>GET /v1/runs/&#123;runId&#125;</code>.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="GET /v1/artifacts/artifact-0dc32dbb" language="json">
        {artifactExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Status values</h2>
      <Table
        head={['Status', 'Meaning']}
        rows={[
          [<code key="r">review</code>, 'Produced and persisted; awaiting operator review.'],
          [<code key="a">approved</code>, 'Reviewed and accepted as the canonical output.'],
          [<code key="rj">rejected</code>, 'Reviewed and discarded. Record kept for provenance.'],
          [<code key="d">draft</code>, 'Intermediate output, not yet user-visible.'],
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Visual artifacts</h2>
      <p>
        A visual artifact has two files: <code>raw</code> (model output) and <code>processed</code> (post
        background removal and any QA passes). Both are stored as WebP. The artifact response includes the public{' '}
        <code>url</code> for the processed file; the <code>storageKey</code> is stable and safe to persist on
        your side.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="visual file paths" language="path">
        {namespace}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Research artifacts</h2>
      <p>
        A research artifact is structured text rather than a file. Its <code>content</code> carries a{' '}
        <code>title</code>, a <code>summary</code>, an ordered list of <code>sections</code>{' '}
        (<code>heading</code> + <code>body</code>), and a list of <code>sources</code>. Sourcing is
        model-derived today; web-search-backed citations land in a later phase.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="GET /v1/artifacts/artifact-7c4e91aa" language="json">
        {researchExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        Research artifacts are reusable on their own and as inputs to other workflows. When a workflow composes a
        research report through a <a href="/docs/concepts/sub-workflows">sub-workflow</a>, the produced artifact (for
        example, an infographic) carries a <code>sourceReportArtifactId</code> back-reference to the report it was
        built from.
      </p>

      <h2 id="artifact-inputs">Artifacts as inputs</h2>
      <p>
        A workflow template can declare that it accepts an existing artifact as input. The author adds
        an intake field of type <code>artifactReference</code>, constrained to the artifact{' '}
        <code>class</code> and <code>type</code> the workflow knows how to read — so the field has a
        defined consumer and the supplied value can be validated.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="an artifactReference intake field" language="json">
        {inputFieldExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        At run time you pass the chosen artifact&rsquo;s id in intake. The engine loads that artifact
        and exposes its content at <code>inputs.&#123;field&#125;</code>, which steps reference like
        any other context — for example <code>&#123;inputs.sourceReport.summary&#125;</code>.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="POST /v1/runs — supplying an artifact input" language="json">
        {inputRequestExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h3>Generate or supply</h3>
      <p>
        A step can declare that a supplied artifact <em>satisfies</em> it. When the input is present,
        the step is skipped and the supplied artifact fills its output slot; when it is absent, the
        step runs normally — for example, generating the artifact through a sub-workflow. Downstream
        steps read the same reference either way, so &ldquo;generate a fresh one&rdquo; and &ldquo;use
        this existing one&rdquo; are interchangeable to the rest of the workflow.

        for a worked example.
