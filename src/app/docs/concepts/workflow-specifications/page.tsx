            A Workflow Specification is the per-run populated instance of a{' '}
            <Link href="/docs/concepts/workflow-templates">Workflow Template</Link>. It captures the operator&apos;s
            inputs, any intermediate artifacts the workflow generated (research, design research), and the
            synthesis decisions made along the way. Production reads it to build the artifact.
          </>
        }
      />

      <h2>Position in the model</h2>
      <p>
        Workflows on Esy are defined at three levels. The Specification is the runtime layer — produced when a{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/concepts/runs">Run</Link> begins, executed by production, then archived with the Run for
        provenance. Many Specifications exist; one per Run.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="levels" language="tree">
        {levelDiagram}
      </CodeBlock>

      <Callout title="Template is the class; Specification is the instance">
        A <Link href="/docs/concepts/workflow-templates">Template</Link> is a class; a Specification is one instance of it
        — <code>new Template(intake)</code> — created fresh for each run. That is why there are many Specifications
        but one Template, and why a Specification is immutable once populated.
      </Callout>

      <h2>What a Specification contains</h2>
      <Table
        head={['Field', 'Purpose']}
        rows={[
          [<code key="id">id</code>, 'Stable identifier for this Specification. Addressable for the lifetime of its Run.'],

      <h2>Example: clip art Specification</h2>
      <p>
        A populated Specification for one Run of <code>generate-clip-art-asset v2026.05.16</code>. Note the pinned
        Template version, the resolved prompt synthesized from the operator&apos;s intake, the locked provider
        bindings, and the deterministic step instructions.

      <CodeBlock title="GET /v1/specifications/spec-7f3c2a91" language="json">
        {specExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Example: visual essay Specification</h2>
      <p>
        A populated Specification for the <code>visual-essay</code> Template scales much larger — typically
        500–1,500 lines of structured content captured during the 14-gate synthesis pipeline. Below is the header
        from a real archived Specification for an essay on the history of silk.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock title="essays/silk/SPEC.md (excerpt)" language="markdown">
        {visualEssaySpecExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Complexity scales with the artifact</h2>
      <p>
        Specifications range from a few lines (trivial workflows where the inputs effectively <em>are</em> the
        Specification) to thousands of lines (visual essays with full multi-layer populated structure). The
        primitive is the same; only the size varies with what is being produced.
      </p>

      <Callout title="Production reads the Specification, never the raw intake.">
        Once a Specification is created, downstream production gates do not look back at the operator&apos;s
        intake. They consult the Specification. This makes synthesis decisions explicit, auditable, and
        replayable. The Specification is the single source of truth for everything that happens after the Run
        starts.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>
        Specifications are consumed by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Production agents and code</strong> — Every runtime step reads from the Specification, not
          from operator intake. This is what makes Runs reproducible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reviewers</strong> inspecting how an artifact was made — provenance investigations, quality
          audits, or debugging when output deviated from intent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Platform tooling</strong> for replays, A/B testing across Template versions, and cost
          attribution.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>One per Run.</strong> Every Run produces exactly one Workflow Specification at the start of
        execution. Specifications are persisted alongside their Run record for the Run&apos;s retention period.
      </p>

      <h2>Provenance</h2>
      <p>
        Every Specification carries pointers up the chain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>schemaVersion</code> — which Workflow Schema version the Template conformed to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>templateId</code> and <code>templateVersion</code> — which Template version was instantiated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>runId</code> — which Run executed this Specification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And pointers down the chain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Artifact(s) produced from this Specification.</li>
        <li>Step telemetry recorded against the Specification&apos;s step instructions.</li>
        <li>Cost reconciliation against the estimated cost.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The full chain (Schema → Template → Specification → Run → Artifact) is queryable for any artifact Esy
        has ever produced.
      </p>
