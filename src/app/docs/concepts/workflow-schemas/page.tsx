      <h2>Position in the model</h2>
      <p>
        Workflows on Esy are defined at three levels of abstraction. The Schema is the highest level — the
        meta-definition that governs how Templates are authored. Most operators never see the Schema directly;
        they pick a Template that has already been validated against it.
      </p>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>
        An illustrative subset of <code>workflow-schema-v1</code>. The Schema itself is a stable declarative document
        that the platform reads when validating new Templates.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock title="workflow-schema-v1.json (excerpt)" language="json">
        {schemaExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The Schema is consumed by three audiences, in order of how often they engage with it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Platform engineers</strong> — Author and version the Schema itself. Decide what counts as a
          valid workflow on Esy. Rarely changes the Schema; when it does, existing Templates either remain on
          their prior Schema version or migrate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workflow designers</strong> — Author new Templates that conform to the Schema. Read it as a
          reference for what fields are required and what shapes are valid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operators</strong> — Almost never. Operators pick Templates that have already been validated
          against the Schema. The Schema is platform-internal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>One per platform, versioned.</strong> The Schema is a singleton across Esy, evolving through
        explicit versions (<code>workflow-schema-v1</code>, <code>workflow-schema-v2</code>). When the Schema
        changes, every Template declares which Schema version it conforms to, and the platform routes validation
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <Callout title="The Schema is the contract. Templates are concrete instances of that contract.">
        Think of the Schema as a TypeScript language specification, and a Template as a specific{' '}
        <code>interface User &#123; ... &#125;</code> declaration. The language spec defines what an interface can
        be; an interface declaration is one concrete shape inside that spec. Multiple Templates can satisfy the
        same Schema, just as many interfaces can be written in TypeScript.
