        }

      <h2>Why composition</h2>
      <p>
        Some artifacts are inputs to others. A research report is valuable on its own, and it is also the
        substrate for a research infographic, a brief, or a slide. Rather than re-implement research inside each
        of those workflows, the report is authored once as <code>generate-research-report</code> and{' '}
        <em>composed</em> by the others. The child run is a first-class Run: it has its own steps, telemetry,
        cost, artifact, and review state.
      </p>

      <h2>The subWorkflow step</h2>
      <p>
        Composition is declared as a runtime step with <code>kind: &quot;subWorkflow&quot;</code>. The step
        pins a child template <strong>id and version</strong> and supplies an <code>intakeMapping</code> — a map
        from parent context paths to the child template&rsquo;s intake field names.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="runtime step" language="json">
        {stepExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <Table
        head={['Field', 'Purpose']}
        rows={[
          [<code key="t">templateId</code>, 'The child Workflow Template to invoke.'],
          [
            <code key="tv">templateVersion</code>,
            'Pinned child version. Composition is reproducible against the exact child definition used.',
          ],
          [
            <code key="im">intakeMapping</code>,
            <>
              Maps a parent context path (for example <code>intake.topic</code>) to a child intake field name
              (for example <code>topic</code>). The engine resolves each path against the parent run context and
              passes the result as the child&rsquo;s intake.
            </>,
          ],
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Parent and child runs</h2>
      <p>
        When the engine reaches a <code>subWorkflow</code> step, it creates a child run linked to its parent by{' '}
        <code>parentRunId</code> and <code>parentStepId</code>. The child executes to completion and persists its
        own artifact; the parent step records the <code>childRunId</code> so the two are navigable in both
        directions in the app.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="run shape" language="tree">
        {runShape}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        The downstream artifact links back to the artifact the sub-workflow produced. An infographic composed
        from a report carries <code>sourceReportArtifactId</code>, so a reader can open the underlying{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/concepts/artifacts">research artifact</Link> from the visual.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost rollup</h2>
      <p>
        A child run captures its own provider cost the same way any run does. The parent run&rsquo;s total is the
        sum of its own step costs plus the totals of every child it spawned, so a composed workflow reports the
        full cost of producing its artifact — not just the parent&rsquo;s steps.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="rollup" language="tree">
        {costRollup}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        Cost <Link href="/docs/concepts/costs">estimation</Link> mirrors this at planning time: estimating a template
        that contains a <code>subWorkflow</code> step resolves the pinned child template and adds its estimate to
        the parent&rsquo;s, so a <Link href="/docs/concepts/budgets">budget</Link> pre-check sees the true per-run cost
        before launch.
      </p>

      <Callout title="Depth and cycles are bounded">
        Sub-workflow composition is guarded against runaway depth and cycles. A template cannot compose itself,
        directly or transitively, and nesting is capped. This keeps a single operator action from fanning out into
        an unbounded tree of runs and cost.
