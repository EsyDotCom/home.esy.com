            Cost tracking in Esy separates estimates from provider-confirmed billing. Every cost has a source, a
            calculation method, and a confidence state — at the step, run, workflow, project, and organization
            level.

      <Callout title="Estimates are not billing">
        Runtime responses include estimated costs immediately so operators can plan budgets, but provider-reported
        and reconciled costs are tracked separately. Final billing comes from provider truth, not Esy estimates.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Cost vs. price</h2>
      <p>
        Two axes are easy to conflate, so Esy keeps them strictly separate. <strong>Cost</strong> is what it costs
        Esy to <em>execute</em> a step — metered provider and resource spend. <strong>Price</strong> is what a
        customer is <em>charged</em> for a template. Everything on this page is about cost; price is a separate
        concern. A template can be priced at <code>$0</code> to a customer and still incur real cost to run, so cost
        docs never describe a step as &ldquo;free&rdquo; — that word only ever describes price.
      </p>

      <h2>Metered and unmetered steps</h2>
      <p>
        Every runtime step is one of two kinds, on the cost axis:
      </p>
      <Table
        head={['Step kind', 'Meaning']}
        rows={[
          [
            <strong key="m">metered</strong>,
            <>
              Consumes a cost-bearing resource — an LLM call, image generation, a tool call, an agent loop, or a
              sub-workflow. A metered step carries a <strong>rate</strong> (its per-unit cost).
            </>,
          ],
          [
            <strong key="u">unmetered</strong>,
            <>
              Consumes no cost-bearing resource — a local string transform, a passthrough, local computation. It
              contributes nothing to run cost. This is <em>not</em> &ldquo;free&rdquo;; it simply incurs no cost
              because there is no metered resource behind it.
            </>,
          ],
        ]}
      />
      <p>
        A metered step&rsquo;s <strong>rate</strong> is resolved from the registry. A rate is{' '}
        <strong>resolved</strong> when the registry has a known per-unit cost for the step&rsquo;s model or tool —
        and that known value may legitimately be <code>0</code>. A rate is <strong>unresolved</strong> when the
        registry cannot price it, which is the case that silently reads as <code>$0</code> while real spend still
        happens.
      </p>

      <h2>Estimability (the publish guard)</h2>
      <p>
        A template is <strong>estimable</strong> when every metered step resolves to a known rate. Estimability is
        enforced at publish time: a template cannot become <code>active</code> if any metered step has an{' '}
        <strong>unresolved</strong> rate. The invariant is about <em>knowing</em> the cost, not about the total
        being non-zero.
      </p>
      <Table
        head={['Case', 'Publish']}
        rows={[
          [
            <>Unmetered step (no cost-bearing resource)</>,
            <>Allowed — contributes nothing to cost.</>,
          ],
          [
            <>Metered step with a <strong>resolved</strong> rate (even <code>0</code>)</>,
            <>Allowed — the cost is known.</>,
          ],
          [
            <>Metered step with an <strong>unresolved</strong> rate</>,
            <>Blocked — the cost is unknown and would silently read as <code>$0</code>.</>,
          ],
        ]}
      />
      <Callout title="Known-zero is not the same as unknown">
        A template made entirely of unmetered steps genuinely costs nothing and publishes fine. A template whose
        metered step references a model or tool the registry can&rsquo;t price is blocked — not because it&rsquo;s
        expensive, but because Esy refuses to publish a cost it cannot account for.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Cost states</h2>
      <Table
        head={['State', 'Meaning']}
        rows={[
          [
            <code key="e">estimated</code>,
            'Computed from Esy pricing snapshots and captured request settings.',
          ],
          [
            <code key="pr">provider_reported</code>,
            'Reported directly by a provider response or usage API.',
          ],
          [
            <code key="r">reconciled</code>,
            'Matched against provider billing or usage records.',
          ],
          [
            <code key="d">disputed</code>,
            'Internal estimate and provider-reported cost diverge beyond tolerance.',
          ],
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Provider cost ledger</h2>
      <p>
        Every provider interaction creates a ledger entry. Run telemetry rolls up these entries into a run-level{' '}
        <code>totalCosts</code> object with the same status semantics; project and organization burn roll up from
        runs.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="provider_cost_ledger entry" language="json">
        {costExample}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        When a run composes a <a href="/docs/concepts/sub-workflows">sub-workflow</a>, each child run keeps its own
        ledger entries; the parent run&rsquo;s <code>totalCosts</code> includes the child run totals, so a composed
        workflow reports the full cost of producing its artifact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each ledger entry is immutable and freezes the price that was applied: its <code>unitPriceUsd</code> and{' '}
        <code>pricingVersion</code> are snapshotted at write time. When a provider price changes later, existing
        entries keep the price they were charged at — nothing recomputes them.
      </p>

      <h2>Vendor vs. model: direct providers and gateways</h2>
      <p>
        Every ledger entry records two things that are easy to conflate: <code>provider</code> is the vendor that{' '}
        <em>invoices</em> you, and <code>model</code> is what actually <em>ran</em>. For direct providers — OpenAI,
        Anthropic — these coincide: you call them, they bill you. For a <strong>gateway</strong> like fal.ai they
        diverge: fal.ai is an API that routes to many underlying models (today <code>birefnet-light</code> for
        background removal; other hosted models later), so the vendor on the invoice is fal.ai while the model that
        ran is something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because both fields live on every entry, the two questions stay separate. Roll up spend by <strong>model</strong>{' '}
        to see what ran — the honest answer to &ldquo;what am I paying for&rdquo;. Roll up by <strong>vendor</strong>{' '}
        to reconcile against the invoices you actually receive. A gateway only ever shows up as a vendor; it is never
        the answer to &ldquo;which capability did I use.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <Callout title="When a gateway routes third-party models">
        If fal.ai later proxies a model such as Gemini, the same fields still carry the truth: <code>provider</code>{' '}
        stays the billing vendor (fal.ai) and <code>model</code> names the real model. A dedicated route/gateway field
        can annotate &ldquo;via fal.ai&rdquo; if that level of provenance becomes useful — the cost model does not have
        to change to support it.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Pricing versions are effective dates</h2>
      <p>
        <code>pricingVersion</code> is an ISO date (<code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>), not an opaque label: it is the day a
        price snapshot took effect. Because every ledger entry copies it, each entry answers &ldquo;what price was in
        effect, and from when&rdquo; on its own — the entry&rsquo;s <code>createdAt</code> tells you when the cost was
        incurred, and its <code>pricingVersion</code> tells you which price schedule applied.
      </p>
      <Callout title="Why this is enough">
        For spend reporting and point-in-time price provenance, the per-entry snapshot plus its <code>createdAt</code>{' '}
        is sufficient — no separate dated rate-card table is required. A standalone pricing history is only needed for
        price-trend or drift analysis, which Esy adds when that need is real.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Pricing sources</h2>
      <Table
        head={['Provider', 'Source of truth']}
        rows={[
          [
