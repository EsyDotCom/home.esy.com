            A <Link href="/docs/concepts/workflow-templates">Workflow Template</Link> is{' '}
            <strong>immutable and versioned</strong>. Its id is stable, but its behavior never changes in place:
            editing a template publishes a <em>new version</em>. Each <Link href="/docs/concepts/runs">Run</Link> pins
            the exact version it executed, so the <Link href="/docs/concepts/artifacts">Artifact</Link> it produced stays
            reproducible against the precise definition that made it.
          </>
        }
      />

      <h2>Immutable versions, stable id</h2>
      <p>
        A template has a stable <code>id</code> (its slug) that identifies the job — for example{' '}
        <code>generate-research-report</code> — and one or more <strong>immutable versions</strong> under that id.
        You never mutate a published version. A change to the prompt, the model pin, the step graph, the gates, or
        the budget policy is published as a new version; the old version is kept exactly as it was.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="versions under a slug" language="tree">
        {versionTree}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Choosing the live version</h2>
      <p>
        Because the id carries many versions, a <strong>movable pointer</strong> selects which one operators get by
        default — the <code>canonical</code> version. Promotion moves the pointer to a newer version; it never
        edits a version. Older versions remain resolvable so historical runs stay reproducible, and a workflow may
        keep opt-in alternates or operator-only shadow versions alongside its canonical one.
      </p>

      <h2>Drafts and publishing</h2>
      <p>
        A template can be saved as a <strong>draft</strong> while it is still incomplete — a half-written prompt or a
        reference that doesn&rsquo;t resolve yet is fine to keep around. <strong>Publishing</strong> it — promoting it
        up the visibility ladder to <code>internal</code> or <code>public</code> (see{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/concepts/workflow-templates#publishing">Publishing &amp; visibility</Link>) — is the gate: the
        definition is validated first, so a template with unresolved references, a forward reference to a later step,
        or a missing sub-workflow cannot be published — and therefore cannot be run. Publishing a valid template is
        what mints the immutable version described above.
      </p>

      <h2>When to bump a version vs. spawn a sibling</h2>
      <p>
        Bump a version when it&rsquo;s the <em>same job</em> — same input and output contract, same intent — served
        by a different model decision. Spawn a separate workflow when the <em>output identity</em> changes: a
        research-assisted variant is a new template, not a new version of an existing one.
      </p>

      <Table
        head={['Bump', 'When', 'Example']}
        rows={[
          [
            <strong key="p">Patch</strong>,
            'Same model family, newer dated snapshot, no behavioral drift',
            <code key="pe">gpt-image-2-2026-04-21 → gpt-image-2-2026-06-15</code>,
          ],
          [
            <strong key="m">Minor</strong>,
            'Model swap in the same quality/cost class with a documented behavior difference',
            'swap one step’s model within the same tier',
          ],
          [
            <strong key="j">Major</strong>,
            'Material change to style, cost, or output shape',
            'replace the image model with a different one',
          ],
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Runs pin the version</h2>
      <p>
        When a run starts, it resolves the template into a{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/concepts/workflow-specifications">Workflow Specification</Link> — the version&rsquo;s definition
        with this run&rsquo;s inputs slotted in — and records the version and a hash of that frozen specification
        (<code>specVersionHash</code>). Editing or promoting the template later cannot change what an in-flight or
        historical run means: each run is anchored to the exact definition it executed.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="what a run pins" language="tree">
        {runRecord}
      </CodeBlock>

      <Callout title="Why immutability">
        Immutable versions make runs reproducible and auditable, keep a template edit from silently changing the
        meaning of past runs, and let a published artifact carry verifiable provenance — the exact version and the
        models that produced it — rather than a hand-maintained label.
      </Callout>

      <h2>On the word &ldquo;manifest&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>manifest</strong> is the serialized, content-addressed form of a single immutable template
        version — the frozen bundle (input contract, pipeline, per-step policy, output contract) identified by a
        hash. It is not a separate concept layered on top of templates; it is what an immutable version{' '}
        <em>is</em> when written down for storage, comparison, or provenance. The marketing site surfaces a
        version&rsquo;s manifest as the public record of what produced an artifact.
