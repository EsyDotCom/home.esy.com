      <h2>The shift</h2>
      <CodeBlock title="one shift" language="ascii">
        {shiftShape}
      </CodeBlock>
      <p>
        Every run a shift creates is attributed to the worker (<code>createdVia: &quot;worker&quot;</code> +{' '}
        <code>workerId</code>), so the whole trail — plan runs, order children, artifacts, spend — is auditable
        per worker, per shift.

      <CodeBlock title="Worker.job" language="json">
        {jobShape}
      </CodeBlock>
      <p>
        Producing is not publishing: <code>publishPolicy</code> is the worker’s selection bar
        (<code>classified</code> publishes only work the classifier titled and categorized; <code>none</code>, the
        default, publishes nothing). <em>Where</em> it ships is the framework below — destination lives on the
        worker’s assignment, never in the job (and never on a goal).
      </p>

      <h3>Every field a content type takes</h3>
      <p>
        A <code>contentType</code> is one thing the worker makes. Each is planned, executed, capped, and published
        independently — a worker with six of them runs six small production lines every shift.

      <Callout title="Two fields named publishPolicy">
        <code>job.publishPolicy</code> is a <em>string</em> deciding whether individual artifacts publish to the
        outlet. <code>job.contentTypes[].publishPolicy</code> is an <em>object</em> deciding whether a finished pack
        is pushed to its ingest endpoint. They are independent, and both default to publishing nothing — a worker can
        cheerfully publish every asset while never shipping a single pack.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Composite output: the publish leg</h2>
      <p>
        Some work is bigger than one artifact. A themed pack is a plan, dozens of assets, product mockups, and a
        cover — and it is worthless delivered in pieces. After an order settles cleanly, the shift runs a{' '}
        <strong>publish leg</strong>: it composes the cover from the pack’s own hero assets, assembles one payload,
        and delivers it signed to the outlet’s ingest URL. Everything is idempotent on the order id, so re-publishing
        is always safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pack that is not clean is never pushed. Failed items, a cover that could not be generated or categorized, or
        a missing outlet each leave the pack <em>staged</em> — and the reason is recorded in the shift report rather
        than swallowed. See{' '}
        <a href="/docs/guides/publish-packs-with-a-worker-team">Publish packs with a worker team</a> for the full
        build.
      </p>

      <h2>Teams, designations, and where work ships</h2>
      <p>
        One law governs distribution: <strong>designations and sections decide where work ships.</strong> Demand
        has its own hierarchy: the team’s <strong>produces</strong> (its domain) → the worker’s{' '}
        <strong>specialty</strong> (narrower, inherited when blank) → <strong>goals</strong> (measurable
        campaigns, refining further). The resolved specialty steers every shift’s planning — and a worker
        cannot exist without one.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>On a designated team → the team’s outlet. Period.</strong> A team with an outlet is a
          publishing contract for the whole crew — the fence. A member’s Solo outlet defers (kept, dormant), a
          matching sibling section can’t poach, and no goal can redirect. “This team publishes only to X” is
          provable, with zero asterisks. A team <em>without</em> an outlet is organizational only.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Otherwise, the home site’s sections sort</strong> — the section outlet matching the artifact’s
          category claims it (<code>/flowers</code> catches <code>flowers</code>): permanent site taxonomy that
          outlives any goal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The rest lands on the worker’s Solo outlet.</strong> No home channel → unpublished, never a
          wrong page. A hard pin for a solo worker is a team of one.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Every publish records its provenance (<code>routedVia</code>) and every assignment change is logged —
        designations are audit-grade. One artifact can still appear in many outlets via{' '}
        <a href="/docs/concepts/outlets">syndication</a>: carrying is the outlet’s act, not the worker’s.
      </p>

      <h2>Stop conditions</h2>
      <p>
        A shift halts — never silently — when a stop condition trips: hard budget caps, a child-failure rate above
        the job’s threshold, or empty and skipped plans. Every breach files a high-priority task and an Inbox
        alert in the worker’s name, with the technical detail attached behind a disclosure.
      </p>

      <Callout title="The inbox speaks human">
        Workers communicate in natural language: what happened, what was done, what needs you. A report may be
        plain (the voice layer falls back to the mechanical summary on any failure) — but it may never be lost,
        and it may never omit assigned work.
      </Callout>

      <h2>What a report must contain</h2>
      <p>
        The prose is short on purpose, so the record rides with it rather than inside it. Every report carries a{' '}
        <strong>manifest</strong> behind a disclosure: each image with its URL and category, each pack with the
        address it published to, its cover, tags and facts — and, for anything that did not ship, the reason it was
        staged instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can make specific facts contractual with <code>messaging.requirements</code>. Each entry becomes a
        &ldquo;must include&rdquo; instruction, so a pack worker can be required to name the address it published to
        every single shift:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock title="job.messaging" language="json">
        {messagingShape}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>Steering a worker</h2>
      <p>
        You steer a worker by <strong>assigning work</strong>, not by editing its job: goals carry measurable
        targets it plans against every shift, and scheduled tasks are day directives it checks off itself. See{' '}
        <a href="/docs/concepts/assigned-work">Assigned work</a>.
